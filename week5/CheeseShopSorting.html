    <h1>Card Sorting Village Cheese Shanty</h1>
  </header>
  	<h2>Project Description</h2>
  		<p>For my project I would like to redesign the website for the village cheese shanty. The village cheese shanty is an amazing sandwich shop in my hometown Leland MI. Located in Fishtown. They sell wraps, sandwiches, cheese, Local Leelanau County Wine and many Michigan beers.  You can tell by the shanty they operate out of that they are sticking to small town appeal, they are not interested in rebranding or expanding. However, I believe they could benefit from an updated fully functioning website without having to change their style. The <a href= "http://WWW.VILLAGECHEESESHANTY.COM/"> CURRENT SITE</a> might just be a web designers worst nightmare.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    	<p>I began my card sorting process by spending some time on the current website site. The current website does not offer much content at all so I had to develop my cards off the top of my head and proceeded by creating index cards containing content titles (14 cards total). Im mixed up my content cards and performed one sort myself and then asked 3 of my roommates to try.</p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    	<p>Unfortunately without access to a full menu and list of products I'm not able to create all the content cards necessary to perform a more throe sorting at this time. My friend who has worked at the cheese shanty for four summers said he could help me put together a menu and item list. Based on my card sorting exercise I was still able to form a basic structure of tabs and content that would be necessary for the redesign: </p>
    <li>Home Page</li>
    <li>Menu</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Beer and Leelanau County Wine</li>
    <li>Merchandise</li>
    <li>Order</li>
    <li>Hours and Contact</li>
    	<p> The cheese shop currently only takes orders in person and phone orders. I believe there would be smoother production and efficiency with online orders. The cheese shop is a somewhat small operation and when they have too many orders they unplug the phone. So there would need to be a function that limited the number of orders when they are busy.</p>
    	<p> Please shoot me an email if you think this may be too much to take on or if you think it will be a good choice for the project schaubb1@msu.edu</p>
