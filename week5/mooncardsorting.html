    <h1>NASA Moon Website Card Sorting</h1>
  </header>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>I began my card sorting process by spending some time on the NASA moon site and proceeded by creating index cards containing content titles (33 cards total). I mixed up my content cards and performed one sort myself and then asked 3 of my roommates to try.</p>
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>The groupings/tabs from my sorts came out to be very similar too the current NASA site. However the content within each grouping varied. In the sorts I performed between my roommates and I the 33 content cards were broken down into 5 groupings:</p>
    <li>News/Events</li>
    <li>Missions</li>
    <li>Multimedia</li>
    <li>People</li>
    <li>History/Info</li>
    <p> There were a couple cards that my roommates had a hard time deciding which grouping they fit into. I allowed them to create a a separate grouping called "outliers". The outliers included: 
    <li>Partners</li> 
    <li>Songs about the moon</li>
    <li>Merchandise</li>
    <p> One of the main issues I noticed in the current NASA site is that they had media content such as photos and videos spread throughout many of their tabs, instead of simply reserving that content within the Multimedia tab. This limits the sites organization and could potentially cause confusion for visitors.</p>
